Adhered to MVC (EVERYONE) - During the last iteration, our group struggled making the transition between swing and JavaFX.  We weren’t sure how to navigate an MVC architecture with a different API.  In order to make the deadline, we crammed our logic into our views, which made an awkward program.  During this iteration, our team primarily focused on making sure that we used MVC properly.  This involved moving all the logic from the view into the controller, where it should have been in the first place.  Additionally, our team is now using models in order to communicate between views, whereas we didn’t do that during the last iteration.
 
Removed Dead Code (Jason) - Jason went through the application and found a bunch of dead code that we didn’t use in the final application.  He investigated whether or not we were going to use the code in the future; however, since the trajectory of the project changed so frequently, he found a few snippets of code that would never be used.  We removed this since we were getting confused with what code was actually being used.

Removed Long Methods (Jon) - The program suffered from cramming too much logic into single methods.  This resulted redundant code since code wasn’t always being reused.  He found this in several scenarios and decided to go back and make the methods more flexible and reusable.  Because of his efforts, other group members were able to utilize his code in their parts, which made building the application easier.

Removed Duplicated Code (Noel) - Noel noticed in several places that we repeated code.  Since he found this, we were able to be less redundant and create an overall more dynamic program.  This will make the code easier to maintain and expand upon in the future.

Added Instance Variables to the Home Screen (Shifan) - Shifan’s part from the last iteration was strong.  The only real criticism his part received was that he didn’t have instance variables in the home screen class, which made it unnecessarily convoluted.  He made this simple fix and also focused on helping the group adhere to MVC
