JASON HITCHINGS:
Composite Structural Pattern - The composite structural pattern is the base design pattern being used in this application. It start out in the login screen, since that is the base of the tree, and branches out from there. 
Pagination - The application runs on a pagination structure, but the page that was focused on was the login screen since that was the part that Jason decided to focus on for this iteration.

SHIFAN ZHENG:
Login Screen and Home Screen - Worked on creating a login screen and home screen for us this iteration. The login screen has an option to create an account for the user. The Home Screen in the app will later show a user summary and function as a sort of quick look into the user’s history of use with the application. 
Mediator - Shifan worked on implementing mediator design into the home screen of the application. The pattern works well with the tab structure that we are using for our application, since the two patterns build off of each other.

NOEL STERLING:
Iterator - The application in general uses the iterator design. Since it starts out in a login screen, then brings you to a home screen, lets you choose functionality, then perform the functionality from there. However Noel’s focus during this iteration of the project was on the moodviews classes. 
Alternating row colors - Alternating row colors will be used throughout the app to make it easier for our users to browse. However since no data has really been added to the app yet and we are on a basic view it hasn’t been implemented as fully as it will be in later versions.

JON YAHR:
Navigation Tabs - Jon’s focus on the navigation tabs for the app was the backbone of this iteration. He provided the layout for the app that became integrated into all of our individual classes and allows them to work together.
Command - The command design pattern stores each action so that it can allow easy manipulation of those actions later in the program’s execution.  The purest example of a command implementation is an undo functionality, which is what Jon decided to implement in this iteration.  When adding to the food list, the user will have the option to undo their actions if they make a mistake.  For this implementation, the add food button adds dummy data.  However, this functionality will be expanded upon in the upcoming weeks.
